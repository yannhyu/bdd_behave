Feature: My Lists # features/my_lists.feature:1
  As a logged-in user
  I want to be able to see all my lists in one page
  So that I can find them all after I've written them
  Scenario: Create two lists and see them on the My Lists page  # features/my_lists.feature:6
    Given I am a logged-in user                                 # features/steps/my_lists.py:19
Not Found: /404_no_such_url/
    When I create a list with first item "Reticulate Splines"   # features/steps/my_lists.py:32
Not Found: /favicon.ico
    And I add an item "Immanentize Eschaton"                    # features/steps/my_lists.py:40
    And I create a list with first item "Buy milk"              # features/steps/my_lists.py:32
    Then I will see a link to "My lists"                        # functional_tests/base.py:12
    When I click the link to "My lists"                         # features/steps/my_lists.py:53
    Then I will see a link to "Reticulate Splines"              # functional_tests/base.py:12
    And I will see a link to "Buy milk"                         # functional_tests/base.py:12
    When I click the link to "Reticulate Splines"               # features/steps/my_lists.py:53
    Then I will be on the "Reticulate Splines" list page        # functional_tests/base.py:12
